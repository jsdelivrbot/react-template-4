# React Template

This is a simple React template using babel and webpack. Every time I wanted to mess around with React code I wanted to have a template suited to my needs. The create-app thing just didn't cut it for me. Therefore I created this template and hopefully it will help you as well. I'm using reactstrap for some parts of the app. I have also included the 'Roboto' font from Google Fonts. Feel free to leave a feedback and most of all enjoy using it!

### How to use?
```
> git clone this project
> cd ReactTemplate
> npm install
> npm start
> go to localhost:8080
```
### TO-DO

Add better config for webpack
Add better documentation 
Configure some styling options out of the box

### Have fun and enjoy!
